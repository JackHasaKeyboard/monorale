By default, the footer will be pushed to the bottom of the page accounting for empty space and will be pushed off the page if content requires it. This depends on #push

To push the footer completely off the page at all times so that it will only be shown by scrolling down, change the height of #push to 100% instead of calc(100% - margin)
